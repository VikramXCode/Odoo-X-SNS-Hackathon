# GitHub Social Authentication

Global Router can be configured to use GitHub as an identity provider for social authentication. Users can then log in to Global Router using their GitHub account.

# Configuration

To enable GitHub as an identity provider, the administrator must first configure GitHub to allow Global Router to authenticate users.

### GitHub Configuration

1. Visit the GitHub OAuth Apps Settings page at [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers).
2. Click on `New OAuth App`.
3. Fill in the following fields:

   - Application Name: `Global Router` or any other name you prefer.
   - Homepage URL: `<globalrouter-frontend-url>` where `<globalrouter-frontend-url>` is the URL of your Global Router Frontend service.
   - Application Description: `Global Router` or any other description you prefer.
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://<globalrouter-backend-url>/accounts/github/login/callback/` where `<globalrouter-backend-url>` is the URL of your Global Router Backend service.
   - If you want the logo, you can find it [here](/globalrouter.png).

### Global Router Configuration

This configuration is done in the [Admin Panel](../../guides/admin_panel.md). You can either launch the panel directly from the `Settings` page or navigate to `/admin` on your Global Router server.

1. Login to Global Router as an administrator and navigate to the `Settings` page.
2. Scroll down to the `Administration Settings` and launch the admin panel.
3. In the admin panel, navigate to the `Social Accounts` section and click the add button next to `Social applications`. Fill in the following fields:

   - Provider: `GitHub`
   - Provider ID: GitHub Client ID
   - Name: `GitHub`
   - Client ID: GitHub Client ID
   - Secret Key: GitHub Client Secret
   - Key: can be left blank
   - Settings: can be left blank
   - Sites: move over the sites you want to enable Authentik on, usually `example.com` and `www.example.com` unless you renamed your sites.

4. Save the configuration.

Users should now be able to log in to Global Router using their GitHub account, and link it to existing accounts.

## Linking to Existing Account

If a user has an existing Global Router account and wants to link it to their Github account, they can do so by logging in to their Global Router account and navigating to the `Settings` page. There is a button that says `Launch Account Connections`, click that and then choose the provider to link to the existing account.
