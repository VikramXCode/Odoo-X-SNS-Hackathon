# Kubernetes and Kustomize (k8s)

_Global Router can be run inside a kubernetes cluster using [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)._

## Prerequisites

A working kubernetes cluster. Global Router has been tested on k8s, but any Kustomize-capable flavor should be easy to use.

## Cluster Routing

Because the Global Router backend must be reachable by **both** the web browser and the Global Router frontend, k8s-internal routing mechanisms traditional for standing up other similar applications **cannot** be used.

In order to host Global Router in your cluster, you must therefor configure an internally and externally resolvable ingress that routes to your Global Router backend container.

Once you have made said ingress, set `PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` and `PUBLIC_URL` env variables below to the url of that ingress.

## Tailscale and Headscale

Many k8s homelabs choose to use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) or similar projects to remove the need for open ports in your home firewall.

The [Tailscale k8s Operator](https://tailscale.com/kb/1185/kubernetes/) will set up an externally resolvable service/ingress for your Global Router instance,
but it will fail to resolve internally.

You must [expose tailnet IPs to your cluster](https://tailscale.com/kb/1438/kubernetes-operator-cluster-egress#expose-a-tailnet-https-service-to-your-cluster-workloads) so the Global Router pods can resolve them.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [example config](https://github.com/seanmorley15/Global Router/blob/main/kustomization.yml) and modify it for your use case.

## Environment Variables

Look at the [environment variable summary](docker.md#configuration) in the docker install section to see available and required configuration options.

Enjoy Global Router! 🎉
